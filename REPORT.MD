#### App description

This app will aid Dutch learners of English as a foreign language in their learning process. Therefore, this app is usable within
educational contexts and usable only for Dutch learners. The app will focus on enriching the vocabulary of the user by means of primarily
exercises. Users may use this app as a complement to the curriculum they are following. Thus, the app is not designed to substitute any
given course, but rather to aid and contribute to a better learning experience.
